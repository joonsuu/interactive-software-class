a. Brief overview of the project.
The project is an TLU ELU project where various studies meet. In the project "Sõnasõber" we are making a web-based application for special-educational children. The main output is sound. The idea is to use EKI speech synthesis to produce certain words and make up sentences with them. The user interacts with the application via touch/tap or types in words for speech synthesis.
b. List of contributors and the main parts of the application they will be focusing on. 
The main contribution is know-how-based and done by special education students and educational technologists. Since it's an interdisciplinary project we also have competency from HCI, development, design and psychology.

c. Possible framework(s) to be used to develop your prototype.
In this stage of the project we are making the application on React framework.

d. Target platform(s) that the prototype will run on. 
Since it's a web-based application, the platform for us is universal. The scalability of the application makes it possible to use it on every device.

e. Guide to installing/running the prototype (this can be filled out later as your progress with developing your prototype).
